      <h2>REDUCE</h2>
      <p>
        'Reduce' is all about creating less waste,<br />
        which is a great way to benefit the environment<br />
        A few things which be included are: <br />
        -Buying only neccessary items <br />
        -Use reusable materials instead of plastic <br />
        -Consuming products with less packaging <br />
        -Donating used items instead of throwing them <br />
        -Repair, dont discard

      <h2>REUSE</h2>
      <p>
        'Reuse' is all about finding new ways <br />
        to use trash so that we don't have to <br />
        throw it away. Reusing materials decreases <br />
        waste and pollution as it reduces the <br />
        need for raw materials and hence,saving <br />
        forest and water supplies. An example of <br>
        this process can be donating of household <br>
        items.

      <h2>RECYCLE</h2>
      <p>
        'Recycling' is all about converting waste, that would normally <br>
        be thrown away, into usable materials and products. This reduces pollution and keeps the environemnt <br>
        clean. An example can be when glass bottles are returned and then <br>
        later processed into new glass products. To know about more about <br>
